In
recognition
of
more
than
two
decades
of
courageous
journalism
in
defiance
of
political
pressure
and
violence
that
cost
the
life
of
his
associate
the
Committee
to
Protect
Journalists
will
present
J
Jesus
Blancornelas
editor
of
the
Mexican
newspaper
Zeta
with
its
prestigious
International
Press
Freedom
Award
When
Blancornelas
and
longtime
colleague
Hector
F
lix
Miranda
co
founded
Zeta
a
feisty
weekly
newspaper
in
the
Mexico
U
S
border
city
of
Tijuana
in
1980
they
set
a
bold
agenda
for
Mexican
journalism
In
a
country
where
the
news
media
had
historically
kowtowed
to
government
interests
and
where
bribe
taking
among
journalists
was
so
commonplace
that
it
spawned
a
litany
of
catchphrases
Zeta
dared
to
provide
what
few
other
Mexican
newspapers
had
hard
hitting
stories
on
Mexico
s
most
vexing
problems
official
corruption
and
drug
trafficking
The
cost
of
Zeta
s
independence
has
been
high
F
lix
a
popular
columnist
known
as
F
lix
the
Cat
whose
writing
frequently
targeted
the
wealthy
and
powerful
was
murdered
in
1988
A
year
before
unidentified
assailants
riddled
the
Zeta
office
with
bullets
And
over
the
years
the
newspaper
has
suffered
waves
of
harassment
ranging
from
confiscation
of
its
issues
to
outright
threats
to
advertisers
F
lix
s
death
is
one
of
10
cases
documented
by
CPJ
over
the
past
decade
of
Mexican
journalists
who
were
murdered
in
apparent
reprisal
for
their
work
In
virtually
every
case
investigations
have
been
incomplete
or
contradictory
leaving
key
questions
unresolved
and
leading
suspects
uninvestigated
Zeta
s
drama
has
played
out
in
one
of
the
most
contentious
and
volatile
regions
of
Mexico
In
1989
Baja
California
was
the
first
state
in
Mexico
to
elect
an
opposition
governor
Ernesto
Ruffo
Appel
of
the
center
right
National
Action
Party
ending
the
political
monopoly
of
the
ruling
Institutional
Revolutionary
Party
PRI
Blancornelas
and
Zeta
played
a
pivotal
role
in
this
historic
political
turning
point
by
providing
a
forum
for
opposition
viewpoints
and
subjecting
previous
governments
to
close
investigative
scrutiny
In
recent
years
Tijuana
has
been
one
of
the
bloodiest
battlegrounds
in
Mexico
s
ongoing
internecine
drug
war
which
threatens
the
country
s
economic
and
political
stability
as
well
as
its
social
fabric
Tijuana
was
also
the
site
in
1994
of
Mexico
s
most
traumatic
political
assassination
since
the
tumultuous
aftermath
of
the
1910
Revolution
when
the
PRI
presidential
candidate
Luis
Donaldo
Colosio
was
assassinated
after
a
campaign
rally
in
the
working
class
Lomas
Taurino
neighborhood
Despite
the
risks
Blancornelas
has
not
been
deterred
Largely
inspired
by
his
example
a
newly
empowered
generation
of
independent
well
trained
journalists
are
rejecting
the
old
habits
of
self
censorship
bribe
taking
and
government
subsidies
to
provide
the
Mexican
public
with
more
balanced
coverage
of
the
news
In
the
spirit
of
the
International
Press
Freedom
Awards
whose
previous
recipients
have
included
the
courageous
Irish
investigative
journalist
Veronica
Guerin
assassinated
in
June
and
other
pioneers
and
guardians
of
a
free
press
who
have
risked
political
persecution
and
personal
hardship
CPJ
is
honored
to
give
an
award
this
year
to
Blancornelas
THE
UPHILL
CLIMB
TO
ESTABLISH
AN
INDEPENDENT
VOICE
IN
TIJUANA
Blancornelas
and
F
lix
launched
Zeta
soon
after
losing
control
of
another
Tijuana
newspaper
ABC
which
they
had
started
in
1977
The
daily
s
hallmark
was
in
depth
reporting
of
government
corruption
In
late
1979
the
paper
was
taken
over
by
a
government
controlled
labor
union
in
a
move
orchestrated
by
Baja
Gov
Roberto
de
la
Madrid
a
member
of
the
PRI
The
takeover
occurred
after
Blancornelas
had
refused
de
la
Madrid
s
demand
that
he
fire
F
lix
the
paper
s
star
columnist
Fearful
that
Zeta
which
picked
up
where
ABC
left
off
would
be
a
target
of
government
reprisal
Blancornelas
decided
to
edit
and
publish
the
paper
from
San
Diego
for
a
couple
of
years
to
avoid
a
shutdown
by
Mexican
authorities
who
controlled
a
newsprint
monopoly
Meanwhile
F
lix
stayed
in
Tijuana
writing
irreverent
columns
about
the
backroom
happenings
of
social
and
political
life
in
Baja
California
FELIX
MURDER
ENRAGES
MEXICAN
PUBLIC
In
1988
F
lix
who
served
as
co
editor
of
Zeta
was
assassinated
while
driving
to
work
along
a
narrow
Tijuana
street
Outrage
followed
his
murder
Thousands
attended
the
funeral
and
an
unusual
alliance
of
Tijuana
journalists
and
political
officials
demanded
justice
They
would
not
allow
this
murder
to
be
left
unsolved
as
had
those
of
many
other
Mexican
journalists
Two
employees
of
a
Tijuana
racetrack
owned
by
the
son
of
a
powerful
PRI
politician
and
power
broker
were
eventually
convicted
of
the
shooting
and
they
are
currently
serving
prison
sentences
But
authorities
never
established
a
motive
for
the
assassination
and
it
is
widely
believed
the
intellectual
authors
remain
at
large
In
the
wake
of
F
lix
s
murder
Blancornelas
continued
to
print
his
colleague
s
name
on
the
masthead
of
Zeta
and
in
each
edition
reproduced
one
of
F
lix
s
columns
opposite
a
black
page
that
asked
Who
killed
me
In
the
year
following
F
lix
s
murder
several
journalists
found
their
careers
threatened
when
they
criticized
how
the
case
was
being
handled
Five
reporters
were
fired
from
the
daily
El
Herald
after
they
published
a
special
edition
critical
of
the
investigation
The
five
later
formed
their
own
weekly
journal
Cambio
21
Two
radio
commentators
were
given
unplanned
vacations
after
opening
their
morning
talk
shows
to
callers
critical
of
the
police
investigation
And
other
journalists
said
they
felt
subtle
pressures
to
tone
down
coverage
of
the
case
BLANCORNELAS
SETS
PRECEDENT
FOR
MEXICAN
JOURNALISTS
FIGHTING
GOVERNMENT
CONTROL
OF
PRESS
With
both
ABC
and
Zeta
Blancornelas
insisted
that
his
newspapers
not
be
beholden
to
anyone
In
an
effort
to
bypass
one
of
the
most
onerous
government
controls
over
the
press
a
requirement
that
all
newsprint
be
purchased
directly
from
the
Mexican
government
s
newsprint
monopoly
Blancornelas
went
to
San
Diego
in
1981
and
there
printed
Zeta
and
exported
it
to
Tijuana
According
to
Blancornelas
Mexican
authorities
could
not
block
Zeta
s
import
because
they
would
have
been
forced
to
do
the
same
with
U
S
publications
entering
the
country
In
1990
Mexican
President
Carlos
Salinas
decided
to
sell
the
newsprint
monopoly
enabling
newspapers
to
buy
newsprint
directly
from
foreign
manufacturers
But
the
lingering
fear
of
government
interference
remains
and
some
Mexican
newspapers
have
opted
to
publish
on
the
U
S
side
of
the
border
Newspapers
in
Hermosillo
Sonora
for
instance
are
printed
in
Tucson
Arizona
and
some
papers
in
Ciudad
Juarez
Chihuahua
are
printed
in
El
Paso
Texas
Blancornelas
has
also
been
an
inspiring
figure
for
those
Mexican
journalists
eager
to
break
the
bribe
taking
habits
of
their
predecessors
As
late
as
1989
it
was
still
common
practice
for
reporters
editors
and
columnists
to
take
money
from
elected
officials
government
bureaucrats
and
businessmen
in
exchange
for
flattering
profiles
or
uncritical
coverage
From
Zeta
s
founding
in
1980
Blancornelas
made
the
paper
s
policy
clear
bribe
taking
is
unacceptable
The
slightest
suspicion
of
bribe
taking
is
cause
for
dismissal
Blancornelas
says
and
to
date
no
cases
have
come
to
light
Journalists
make
good
money
here
They
don
t
need
it
bribes
he
said
Zeta
s
example
has
helped
bring
about
a
sea
change
in
the
way
Mexican
journalists
do
business
and
how
they
view
their
role
In
1990
Baja
California
Gov
Ruffo
prohibited
state
officials
from
offering
government
bribes
to
journalists
Former
Mexican
President
Carlos
Salinas
de
Gortari
enacted
a
similar
policy
among
his
cabinet
As
a
result
says
Blancornelas
the
tradition
bound
daily
newspapers
have
no
other
recourse
but
to
change
their
tainted
politics
speak
the
truth
and
learn
to
survive
through
advertising
and
circulation
sales
or
die
Blancornelas
refusal
to
abide
by
the
status
quo
which
has
shackled
and
silenced
Mexico
s
press
has
helped
myriad
publishers
editors
and
reporters
find
the
courage
to
build
a
free
and
independent
press
there
Throughout
Mexico
Blancornelas
has
been
recognized
as
a
pioneer
a
rare
example
of
courage
and
independence
in
the
provincial
press
for
more
than
two
decades
